- **Threshold Comparison**: Real-time hazard detection
- **Alert Management**: Coordinated visual and audio responses
- **Status Reporting**: Serial communication for monitoring

### üîê Configuration Parameters

```cpp
int gasThreshold = 50;      // Gas detection sensitivity
int flameThreshold = 500;   // Flame detection sensitivity
```

### Debug Levels

- **Level 1**: Basic sensor readings
- **Level 2**: Threshold comparison results
- **Level 3**: Alert system status
- **Level 4**: Detailed system diagnostics

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system continuously monitors environmental conditions and responds to detected hazards with appropriate alert mechanisms.

### üîß Setup Stage

1. **Pin Configuration**: Initialize all input/output pins
2. **Serial Communication**: Establish 9600 baud rate connection
3. **System Reset**: Clear all outputs and set safe state
4. **Startup Confirmation**: Display ready message

### üîÑ Loop Stage

1. **Sensor Reading**: Read analog values from both sensors
2. **Data Processing**: Compare readings against thresholds
3. **Hazard Classification**: Determine threat level and type
4. **Alert Activation**: Trigger appropriate response pattern
5. **Status Update**: Output current system state
6. **Delay Cycle**: 2-second monitoring interval

## üß™ Status Codes

| Status | LED Color | Buzzer Pattern | Description |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Safe | Green | Silent | Normal operation |
| Gas Detected | Blue | Intermittent Beep | Gas leak detected |
| Fire Detected | Red | Continuous Siren | Flame/fire detected |
| Critical Alert | Red/Blue Blink | Loud Alarm | Both hazards present |

## üîß Customization Options

### Adjust Update Frequency

Modify the delay value in the main loop:
```cpp
delay(2000);  // Change to desired interval (milliseconds)
```

### Modify Offline Storage

Add EEPROM storage for threshold values:
```cpp
#include <EEPROM.h>
// Store thresholds in EEPROM for persistence
```

### Change Debug Level

Add debug level control:
```cpp
int debugLevel = 2;  // 0=Silent, 1=Basic, 2=Detailed
```

### Configure Timezone

For timestamped logging:
```cpp
#define TIMEZONE_OFFSET +5.5  // GMT+5:30 for India
```
