Technology meets sustainability for a greener tomorrow!

Thrilled to unveil my Smart Irrigation System—a real-time solution combining technology and sustainability! Built around the reliable Arduino Uno, my system features :

         🌡 Temperature & Humidity Sensors : Keeping a pulse on environmental conditions.
         💧 Soil Moisture Sensors : Tailoring water delivery for healthier soil.
         🌞 LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) : Responding intelligently to changing light levels.
         ⚡ Relay Module : Automating water flow like never before.
         💡 LED Indicators : Keeping the system user-friendly and responsive.
         🚰 Water Pump Integration : Automatically delivering water to fields as per the soil’s needs.
         ⚡ Relay Module : For accurate control.
         🔔 Buzzer Alerts: For timely notifications.
